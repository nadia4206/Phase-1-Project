# Phase 1 Project

This website allows a user to keep a collection of their favorite TV shows. Viewers of the users collection are able to "like" TV shows in the collection. 

This website uses a local JSON file with data as well as the Single Show Search TV Maze Public API (https://www.tvmaze.com/api#show-single-search) to retrieve data via the form at the top of the webpage. 

## Introduction
We've build out an app for rating and reviewing tv shows. We've used a local API order to build it out.
## General information
This project is part of Flatiron Schools software Engineering program, Phase 1. Phase one focused on learning about the basic's of Javascript, DOM Manipulation, and how to build out a front end one page program.
